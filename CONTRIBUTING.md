## Contribution Inspiration
Contributions should detail any/some/all of the following items:
  - Which data sets you're currently using and how you're accessing them
  - How you're using said data sets
  - General experience with the data set and tips to facilitate the process for new startups
  - Addition of example data sets or ingest scripts that you found helpful
  - Some folks have had success purely working from the provider's documentation. If there was any documentation you found particularly helpful, either link it, or add it to the repo.
